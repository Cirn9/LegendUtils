You will need 3 external jars for this to compile: Bukkit, Craftbukkit and Permissions

Latest recommended Bukkit: http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-Bukkit/promotion/latest/Recommended/
Latest recommended Craftbukkit: http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/promotion/latest/Recommended/
****** FOR THE TIME BEING USE THIS LINK INSTEAD (update as necessary): http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/1152/artifact/target/craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Permissions: http://dev.bukkit.org/media/files/538/90/PermissionsEx-1.13-package.zip
****** All you need is Permissions.jar

Config is written to plugins/LegendUtils/config.yml

Use LegendUtils.config.write to write your own config strings, read them with readString, readBoolean, readDouble, etc.

Take a look in bitlegend.legendutils.Commands.XpCleanup for Permissions example.

If you add new commands, make sure to include them in plugin.yml or they wont work. Also, use spaces instead of tabs. Tabs break yaml.

****** PLEASE DON'T COMMIT/PUSH UNLESS YOU HAVE TESTED YOUR CHANGES AND THEY WORK
